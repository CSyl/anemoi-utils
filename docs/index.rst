   This documentation is work in progress.

*Anemoi* is a framework for developing machine learning weather
forecasting models. It comprises of components or packages for preparing
training datasets, conducting ML model training and a registry for
datasets and trained models. *Anemoi* provides tools for operational
inference, including interfacing to verification software. As a
framework it seeks to handle many of the complexities that
meteorological organisations will share, allowing them to easily train
models from existing recipes but with their own data.

This package provides a series of utility functions for used by the rest
of the *Anemoi* packages.
